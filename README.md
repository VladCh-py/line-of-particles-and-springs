# line-of-particles-and-springs
This repository contains two .py files with simulation of waves moving in a chain made of some particles (same or different masses) tied together with springs (same  stiffness coefficient).

#1_final.py
This program allows to simulate 1 dimension movement of similar particles tied up with the same springs. movement starts by withdrawal from a position of equilibrium of one particle. Parameters may be changed to observe different cases. After start program will start the animation of chain of particles and its displacement. It is possible to skip the animation by pressing "esc" if necessary. In the end program show graphics of displacement of some particles from time.

#2_final.py
This program allows to simulate 1 dimension movement of particles with different masses tied up with the same springs. movement starts by withdrawal from a position of equilibrium of one particle. Parameters may be changed to observe different cases. After start program will start the animation of chain of particles and its displacement. It is possible to skip the animation by pressing "esc" if necessary. In the end program show graphics of displacement of some particles from time.
